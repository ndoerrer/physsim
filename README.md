# physsim

## A	General information

This is an experimental project, a simple physics engine in java.
For remote interaction it is possible to run this as a server to connect to.

## B	Installation

To install the software, clone the git repository

	git clone https://github.com/ndoerrer/physsim

change directory to physsim and run the java build tool ant

	ant

## C	Usage

For now, in the early state of development there is only a small test program
for the engine available. Run it from the build directory via

	java physsim.exec.TestPhyssim

If you want to do something else with the engine, you have to customize the
TestPhyssim class. Right now it runs server and client locally.

## D	Pictures

Only a quick snap for now. More to come later.
